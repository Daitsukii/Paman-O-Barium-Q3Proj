		<p>The name Abortion Access is pretty self-explanatory. According to Advocates for Youth (n.d.), "Abortion is a part of people's lives and has been throughout history." We can't understand all of what others went through, so we must not force them what to do to their lives. We must protect abortion because there are millions of these people that have gone through difficult times, and we must not force them to give birth in their already difficult lives.</p>
		<p>Safe abortion access is a human right, and an important one. Everyone has a right to life, health, to be free from violence, discrimination, and inhuman treatment (Amnesty International, n.d.). A right to life means to be free from unsafe, deadly methods of abortion. A right to health means this safe way of abortion must be accessible to all. Banning abortion is inhuman treatment, as it increases financial problems and even deaths.</p>
		<p>According to the World Health Organization (2021), unsafe abortion can lead to internal bleeding, infection, uterine perforation, and damage to the genital tract and internal organs. This is why we need the right to safe abortion. Legalizing safe abortion for all can and will reduce the number of casualties due to abortion each year from 4.7-13.2% to as low as 0%.</p>

		<h1>Abortion Access in the Past</h1>
		<p>Since 1973, abortion was legal due to the US Supreme Court's ruling in the Roe v. Wade case (Center for Reproductive Rights, n.d.). Just recently, in June 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and criminalized a fundamental right, the right to abortion.</p>
		<p>According to Baker (2022), this wasn't the first time abortion was outlawed. Actually, even before the first ban against abortion, enslaved women would practice abortion themselves when they were impregnated by their owners. The Comstock Act of 1873, or Anthony Comstock's "chastity laws," criminalized information relating to birth control, sex, and methods of abortion.</p>
		<p>The feminist movement also fought against abortion bans until, finally, the Roe v. Wade ruling made abortion legal. Unfortunately, it's still not attainable by all people. And now that abortion was outlawed once more, we must fight for the right.</p>
