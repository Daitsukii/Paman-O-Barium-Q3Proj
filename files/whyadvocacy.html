		<p>This advocacy is for me because I just think about what happens to babies with no financial support from their mother. Pregnancy must be a right, and we must have the right to terminate it if we're not ready yet. If we hadn't legalized abortion, many children would be suffering in poverty.</p>
		<p>This is especially a necessity in the Philippines where abortion is illegal and many people live under poverty and will have a difficult time in pregnancy. Abortion must be legalized in the Philippines and be accessible to all to lessen the suffering of our fellow Filipinos.</p>
		<p>This is why you should also consider fighting for abortion access, especially in the Philippines. There's nothing more cruel then letting a child be born without their basic needs such as food, water, shelter, etc.</p>

		<h1>How you can help</h1>
		<p>According to the Center for Reproductive Rights (2022), here are some things you can do to support this movement:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Donate to abortion funds. Your donation will help making abortion access more accessible to more people. You can also support the <a href="https://pinsan.ph/">Philippine Safe Abortion Advocacy Network</a> (PINSAN), a non-governmental organization, in reaching the goal of a country where abortion is accessible to all.</li>
			<li>Speak up. Tell your friends and family about abortion access. Share the information on why abortion access is a necessity. To help others, we need you to speak up.</li>
			<li>Fight for the right. Show others you are committed to this movement. Convince lawmakers to fight for our side as well.</li>
		</ol>
